# Overview

I've worked a little with react-native in the past but I wanted something that would push my knowledge. I also wanted to work on building better Objects in javascript, which this has helped me to do.

This App is meant to have you workout with. It has a rest timer, and it also has buttons to click to keep track of the workout.

Again I wanted to do a basic project in react-native. To explore the boundries. I also wanted to make a app that I could personally use.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used React-Native with Expo Go.

I used a variatie of packages with it. including stacks, ands sounds. in react native or expo. I also used. Firebase for the backend, as it is free, for authentications.
