# Overview

In this project I wanted to make a app that I would use. I was tired of having to pay for apps, that were poorly designed, and decided to make my own.

This app is for weight lifting. If you want to use I will shortly put it on the app store.

This app is to help me get to speed with react native, and to play around with objects in js.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used expo go for the environment for react native. For packages I've used quite a few, including async for on device storage. I use line chart from react native too.
